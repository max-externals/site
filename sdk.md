# Max/MSP SDK (Software Development Kit)

## The SDK (Software Development Kit)

[Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/) has an extensive SDK (Software Development Kit) for developing new objects for the Max/MSP visual programming environment. 
The latest version of the SDK is the 8.0.3. It contains the API (headers, source, libraries) for building external objects in C/C++. 
It additionally includes documentation of the API and example projects using the [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) and [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/it/) development environments.

## Download and place the SDK 

You can download the SDK here: [download sdk 8.0.3](https://cycling74.com/downloads/sdk). 
The SDK is structured as a Max package. Simply place the SDK in your `Max/Packages` folder to begin working.

## Online API documentation

You can find the latest online documentation of the SDK here: [API documentation](https://cycling74.com/sdk/max-sdk-8.0.3/html/index.html).
The SDK documentation is accompanied by a series of projects for compiling some example Max/MSP external objects. 
When you build the example projects, the resulting Max external will be located in a folder called "externals" at the top level of the SDK package.

## Testing your code

It is highly recommended that you test your code thoroughly. One option is use the [max-test](https://github.com/Cycling74/max-test) package.
